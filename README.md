## Goal:  
To use influenza trends to provide insights to help medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as needed basis.
## Core Objectives  
**1. Analyze state-level patterns in flu-related deaths (2009–2017).**
- Examine historical flu-related death rates across all U.S. states to uncover geographical patterns and emerging hotspots.
  
**2. Focus on deaths among vulnerable populations (65+).**
- Identify where this population is most at risk and how that risk has shifted over time.

**3. Leverage Data visualizatons for actionable insights.** 
- Transform raw data into clear visual guidance for staff deployment, resource planning, and seasonal preparedness.

## Data
  **Data:** Influenza Mortality Data   
  **Source:** U.S. Centers For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) through National Center For Health Statistic.     
  - This dataset provides a detailed count of influenza-related deaths by state and age group in the United State, spanning the years 2009 to 2017.

  **Data:** Population data by Geography, Age, Time and Gender.   
  **Source:** US Census Bureau  
  - This dataset provides a detailed breakdown of the population count across defined age group, as well as by states and counties in the United State, covering the period from 2009 to 2017. 
## Tools
The tools used for this project include 
1. Excel
   - Pivot Table: To group, summarize and analyze the data.
   - VLOOKUP() function: To transform and integrate data from diffrent sources using key varibale.
   - Statistical function: To calculate standard deviation, correlations, apply the Empirical Rule, and compute z-scores to identify patterns, variability, and potential outliers.
   - T.TEST() function: for statistical hypothesis testing, manual calculation of t-scores, and T.DIST.2T() to derive p-values.
2. Tableau: To create Interactive dashnboard and visualizations.
3. Microsoft word: For documentation Purposes.
4. Power Point: for data Storytelling and Presentation to stakeholders.
5. Video Recording:  Project walkthroughs, narrated analysis, insights communication.
